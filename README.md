Productivity and Time Management App for Students struggling in Online Education.

## Overview

The problem we want to solve – Covid has impacted most students; many of them cannot focus on academics and get distracted due to the internet as everything is online and it affects their studies. Many people get zoned out, miss deadlines, cannot keep track of the pending work(assignments,quizzes), etc.

Detailed abstract solution – We wish to create an app that has features like to-do lists, Pomodoro timers, lo-fi music, calendar with highlighted deadlines.

The impact we wish to create – Pomodoro timers have proven scientifically to be a very effective method, it can help them stay focussed, many people including us love to study while listening to lo-fi music; to-do lists and deadline calendar can help them keep track of all the deadlines and important tasks and dates.
